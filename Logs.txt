the code for course enrollment, add course, remove course, review course description, show a list of course will be responsible by Haocheng, Wenxu, and Tao

2023.2.5 Code Design Time: 2 hours 16 mins
We first of all create a random course list. At this stage, we want courses to be stored in one class with the attributes of course name, course price, course description Note: the attributes are set to be private since we don't want users to access each other's info
create a No-arg constructer that sets the course's name and description as none, and sets the price as -1 which indicates for later creation of course object, we are able to know that whether the object is created successfully
showEverything method is created for course class, which displays name, description and price
Test class is created to test whether showEverything method is working
course aerobic = new course("aerobic",1000,"enhace cardio-pulmonary function"); aerobic.showEverything();
output: [name=aerobic, price=1000, desc=enhace cardio-pulmonary function] so the funtion work
